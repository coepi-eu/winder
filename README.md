Winding the wire for a BLDC motor is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. This winding machine automates this tedious tasks.

## Motors
This machine uses four motors to perform the winding operation:

- **M0**: Move M1 unit (closed loop control)
- **M1**: Rotate the stator (closed loop control)
- **M2**: Wind the wire (closed loop control)
- **M3**: Adjust the wire tension (closed loop torque control using voltage)

code: [Aotenjo One](https://github.com/aotenjo-xyz/one)

## Master Controller
All motors are controlled by Aotenjo Master, a master controller board based on the STM32G431CBU6 microcontroller. It communicates with the host computer via USB and controls the motors via CAN bus.
